# Predicting-Song-Popularity-Using-Spotify-Data

Every 2 weeks, Tidy Tuesday shares a new dataset to promote data exploration. I’m working with the Spotify Songs dataset, which includes detailed variable descriptions on GitHub. The primary goal is to predict a song's popularity based on features. I'll read the data into a Pandas DataFrame from the project.

## Applied Predictive Modeling: End-to-End Statistical Analysis & Model Evaluation
###  Project Context

The goal was to demonstrate the full analytical workflow required to responsibly analyze real-world data, from exploratory analysis and clustering through statistical modeling, prediction, and cross-validated model evaluation.

The emphasis of this project is not just model accuracy, but:

Understanding the data-generating process

Interpreting model coefficients

Quantifying uncertainty

Comparing model complexity vs. performance

Making defensible conclusions supported by multiple analytical techniques

All work is documented and executed in the accompanying Jupyter notebook, with figures and discussion included where required.

### Problem Framing

The project was approached as a [regression / classification] problem (depending on my final modeling decision). 
Key objectives included:

Identifying which inputs/features most influence the outcome

Comparing multiple model formulations of increasing complexity

Evaluating performance on both training data and unseen data

Visualizing predictions and associated uncertainty

Selecting a best model based on cross-validated performance

### Project Structure Overview

The notebook is organized into six major sections
* 1️⃣ Introduction
* 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  The EDA section establishes a deep understanding of the dataset before any modeling decisions are made.
* 3️⃣ Clustering Analysis
* 4️⃣ Models: Fitting & Interpretation 
  This section forms the core statistical modeling component of the project.
* 5️⃣ Models: Predictions & Uncertainty Visualization
* 6️⃣ Models: Performance & Cross-Validation
